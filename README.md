# BhargaviK-W11_Graded-Assignment-

Objective:

Implementing a microservice using the Python Flask framework on an Ubuntu virtualmachine to serve a machine learning prediction model.
Tocreate a Docker image containing everything neededto run the application: theapplication code, libraries, tools, dependencies, and other files and to use the image to runthe application in containers.


Steps to be performed:
  1.Host a Ubuntu Virtual Machine using Oracle VM Virtual Box. 
  2.Set up Visual Studio code on Ubuntu VM. 
  3.Set up Python. 
  4.Clone this Github repositoryhttps://github.com/Vikas098766/Microservices.git
  5.Create a Virtual Environment. 
  6.Install the dependencies from requirements.txt file. 
  7.Train and save the model. 
  8.Test the Flask web application. 
  9.Test the application and make predictions using the example calls available in the     folder/tests.
  10.Create a docker image containing everything needed to run the application.
  11.Run the containerized application as a prediction service and test it locally by        passingsome example calls and get the prediction.
